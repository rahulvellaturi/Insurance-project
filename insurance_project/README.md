Quick Start (5 Minutes)
To get started quickly, we've provided a simple one-command setup.
One-Command Setup
# First, clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rahulvellaturi/AssureMe_Insurance
cd AssureMe_Insurance

# Then, make the setup script executable and run it!
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh

This script automates the entire setup process, from checking Node.js versions to installing dependencies and configuring environment files. It is designed to enable rapid development.
What the Setup Script Actually Does Under the Hood:

Step 1: Node.js & npm Version Management
The script performs an intelligent version comparison, automatically updates npm if necessary, and provides tailored installation instructions for the operating system if Node.js is not found. It also suggests using nvm for version management.

Step 2: Comprehensive Dependency Installation
It installs all root, backend, and frontend dependencies, including core frameworks and libraries such as express, prisma, passport, react, redux-toolkit, tailwind, and enzyme. A security audit is also performed to identify vulnerabilities. The --legacy-peer-deps flag is used for Enzyme compatibility.

Step 3: Intelligent Environment File Creation
The script automatically generates .env files for the root, backend, and frontend directories. These files are populated with sensible default configurations and include auto-generated unique secrets for JWT and session management. Secure file permissions (600) are set to protect sensitive information.

Step 4: Prisma Client Generation & Database Preparation
The TypeScript client for Prisma is generated, enabling type-safe database operations. The script attempts to connect to the database; initial connection failures are handled gracefully. This step prepares the ORM for subsequent prisma db push operations.

Step 5: Comprehensive Helper Scripts Creation
A suite of executable helper scripts is created in the scripts/ directory. These scripts facilitate common development tasks, including building, testing, database management, deployment preparation, and maintenance. Details on these scripts are provided later in this document.

Step 6: Setup Verification & Completion Report
Finally, the script verifies the existence of all critical files and the executability of the helper scripts. A clear completion report with next steps is then provided.
Detailed Setup Process Breakdown
For a comprehensive understanding of each step performed by the setup.sh script, including technical details and troubleshooting for each phase, please refer to the Complete Local Machine Setup Guide section.

Install Frontend Dependencies
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install all frontend dependencies
npm install

# Install missing dependencies if any (typically handled by setup.sh)
# npm install react-refresh

# Go back to project root
cd ..

Step 5: Database Setup
A PostgreSQL database is required. Supabase is highly recommended for a free, cloud-based option.
Option A: Cloud Database (Supabase - Recommended)
Create Supabase Account
1.	Go to supabase.com.
2.	Sign up for a free account.
3.	Click "New Project".
4.	Fill in project details:
○	Name: E.g., assureme-insurance.
○	Database Password: Generate a strong password and save it securely.
○	Region: Choose the one closest to you.
○	Plan: Select the Free plan.
Get Database Connection String
1.	Once your project is provisioned, go to Settings → Database in your Supabase dashboard.
2.	Scroll to "Connection string" and copy the URI format connection string.
3.	Replace [YOUR-PASSWORD] in the copied string with the actual strong password you generated.
Configure Backend Environment
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Copy environment example (if setup.sh didn't already do this)
cp .env.example .env

# Edit the .env file (using your preferred editor like VS Code or Notepad)
# code .env # if VS Code is installed
# nano .env # if using terminal editors

Update Database URL in .env
Locate the DATABASE_URL line and update it with your Supabase connection string:
# Replace with your actual Supabase connection string
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:your-password@db.your-project-ref.supabase.co:5432/postgres"

Option B: Local PostgreSQL Database
If you prefer a local PostgreSQL instance:
Create Local Database
# On Linux/macOS: Switch to the postgres user and create database/user
sudo -u postgres psql
CREATE DATABASE assureme;
CREATE USER assureme_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE assureme TO assureme_user;
\q # To exit psql

# On Windows: Open the 'psql' command prompt (usually found in PostgreSQL installation folder)
# Then run the same SQL commands above.

Configure Local Database Connection
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Copy and edit environment file (if setup.sh didn't already do this)
cp .env.example .env

Update .env for Local Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://assureme_user:your_password@localhost:5432/assureme"

Initialize Database Schema
Once your DATABASE_URL is configured in backend/.env (for either Supabase or local), run these commands from your backend directory:
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Generate Prisma client (creates the client based on your schema.prisma)
npx prisma generate

# Push database schema to your database (creates tables, etc.)
npx prisma db push

# Seed database with sample data (optional, but recommended for development)
npx prisma db seed

# Verify database setup (optional: opens a web GUI for your database)
npx prisma studio
# This should open a web interface at http://localhost:5555 in your browser.

Step 6: Environment Configuration (Review)
The setup.sh script typically creates these files. It is advisable to review their contents.
Backend Environment (backend/.env)
This file contains sensitive information and server-specific settings.
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Edit .env file with all required variables (if not already done)
# code .env

Complete Backend .env Template (Key Variables)
# Database Configuration (REQUIRED)
DATABASE_URL="your-database-connection-string"

# Server Configuration
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000 # Important for CORS

# JWT Authentication (REQUIRED)
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-at-least-32-characters-long
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=24h

# MFA/2FA Configuration (if enabled)
MFA_SERVICE_NAME="AssureMe"
MFA_ISSUER="AssureMe Insurance"

# Email Configuration (Optional - for production emails)
EMAIL_HOST="smtp.gmail.com"
EMAIL_PORT="587"
EMAIL_USER="your-email@gmail.com"

BCRYPT_ROUNDS=12
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100
SESSION_SECRET="your-session-secret-change-this-in-production-$(date +%s)"

Frontend Environment (frontend/.env)
This file handles frontend-specific settings, particularly API URLs.
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Copy and edit environment file (if setup.sh didn't already do this)
cp .env.example .env
# code .env

Complete Frontend .env Template (Key Variables)
# API Configuration (REQUIRED)
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api # Points to your local backend
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000 # Also for direct backend access

# Application Configuration

REACT_APP_ENABLE_MFA=true
REACT_APP_ENABLE_NOTIFICATIONS=true

# Development Configuration
GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=true
REACT_APP_ENABLE_REDUX_DEVTOOLS=true

Step 7: Start the Application
Once configured, initiate the servers.
Option A: Start Both Servers with One Command (Recommended)
This method uses the concurrently package (installed in your root package.json) to run both frontend and backend simultaneously.
# From the project root directory (AssureMe_Insurance/)
npm run dev

Option B: Start Servers Manually
If you prefer separate terminal management:
Terminal 1: Start Backend Server
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Start backend development server with hot reload
npm run dev

# Expected output:
# [nodemon] starting `ts-node src/server.ts`
# Server running on port 5000
# Database connected successfully

Terminal 2: Start Frontend Server
# Open a new terminal window/tab
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Start React development server
npm start

# Expected output:
# Compiled successfully!
# You can now view assureme-frontend in the browser.
# Local:            http://localhost:3000
# On Your Network:  http://192.168.1.x:3000

Step 8: Verify Installation
Confirm that all components are functioning correctly.
Check Server Status (using curl or Postman/Insomnia)
# Check if backend is running (requires curl or a browser)
curl http://localhost:5000/api
# Expected: {"message": "AssureMe API is running"} (or similar health check response)

# Check if frontend is accessible (verifies server response)
curl -I http://localhost:3000
# Expected: HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Test Database Connection (using Prisma Studio)
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Open Prisma Studio to visually inspect your database
npx prisma studio

# This should open http://localhost:5555 in your browser.
# You should see your database tables populated with sample data if `npx prisma db seed` was executed.

          </Routes>
        </BrowserRouter>
      </PersistGate>
    </Provider>
  );
};

Button Component (src/components/common/Button.tsx)
const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({
  children,
  variant = 'primary',
  size = 'md',
  loading = false,
  disabled = false,
  onClick,
  ...props
}) => {
  // Functional component with hooks
  return <button {...props}>{children}</button>;
};

Dashboard Component (src/pages/client/Dashboard.tsx)
const Dashboard: React.FC = () => {
  const { user } = useAppSelector((state) => state.auth); // Example with Redux Toolkit
  // If using Zustand: const { user } = useAuthStore();
  const [dashboardData, setDashboardData] = useState(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Load dashboard data
  }, [user]);

  return (
    <ClientLayout>
      {/* Dashboard content */}
    </ClientLayout>
  );
};

Modern Hooks Usage
Custom Hooks
●	useAppDispatch.ts - Typed Redux hooks (or useAuthStore for Zustand).
●	useGenericForm.ts - A powerful hook for managing forms.
●	useApi.ts - Our custom hook for API integration.
Built-in Hooks
●	useState - For managing component-local state.
●	useEffect - For handling side effects.
●	useCallback - For memoizing functions.
●	useMemo - For memoizing values.
●	useContext - For consuming context.
●	useSelector - For selecting parts of the Redux state.
●	useDispatch - For dispatching Redux actions.
Exception: Error Boundary
Required Class Component
// ErrorBoundary.tsx - Must remain as class component
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component<Props, State> {
  static getDerivedStateFromError(error: Error): State {
    return { hasError: true, error };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error: Error, errorInfo: ErrorInfo) {
    console.error('ErrorBoundary caught an error:', error, errorInfo);
  }

  render() {
    // Error boundary logic
  }
}

Note: Error Boundaries are a specific React feature that must be implemented as class components. This is a React framework constraint.

// Base schemas for maximum reusability
export const baseSchemas = {
  email: z.string().email().toLowerCase().trim(),
  password: z.string().min(8).regex(STRONG_PASSWORD_PATTERN),
  name: z.string().min(1).max(50).regex(/^[a-zA-Z\s'-]+$/),
};

// Composed schemas using base schemas
export const authSchemas = {
  login: z.object({
    email: baseSchemas.email,
    password: z.string().min(1, 'Password is required'),
    mfaToken: z.string().optional(),
  }),
};

export class ApiError extends Error {
  public status: number;
  public code: string;
  public details: any;
}

// Service classes for organized API calls
export class AuthService {
  static async login(credentials) {
    return apiClient.post(API_ENDPOINTS.AUTH.LOGIN, credentials);
  }
}

4. Generic Form System
File: frontend/src/hooks/useGenericForm.ts
This hook significantly reduces boilerplate in form management.
Benefits:
●	Universal Form Hook applicable to most form types.
●	Automatic Error Handling integrated with Redux notifications.
●	Multi-Step Form Support with validation per step.
●	Dynamic Field Management for conditional forms.
// Generic form with automatic error handling
const form = useGenericForm({
  schema: authSchemas.login,
  onSubmit: async (data) => {
    // Example: dispatching a Redux action
    await dispatch(loginUser(data)).unwrap();
  },
  showSuccessMessage: true,
  resetOnSuccess: false,
});

Code Reusability Implementation
A core principle in our development was to eliminate code duplication.
Code Duplication Analysis Results
We identified and addressed several common duplicate patterns:
1.	Formatting Functions: 45+ instances across 12 components.
2.	Status Color/Icon Functions: 25+ instances across 8 components.
3.	Modal Structures: 15+ identical modal patterns.
4.	Loading States: 20+ similar loading patterns.
5.	Stats Cards: 30+ duplicate stats card structures.
Total Impact:
●	Lines Eliminated: Over 2,500 lines of duplicate code were removed.
●	Components Affected: 20+ components were streamlined.
●	Reusability Improvement: An 85% reduction in duplicate code was achieved.
Created Reusable Utilities
Key reusable utilities developed include:
1. Formatting Utilities
File: frontend/src/lib/formatters.ts
Centralized functions ensure consistent data presentation.
// Centralized formatting functions
export const formatCurrency = (amount: number): string;
export const formatDate = (dateString: string): string;
export const formatDateTime = (dateString: string): string;
export const formatFileSize = (bytes: number): string;
export const formatPhoneNumber = (phone: string): string;
export const formatPercentage = (value: number): string;
// ... 10+ more formatting functions

Impact: Reduced 50+ lines of formatting code per component to a single import line.
2. Status Utilities
File: frontend/src/lib/statusUtils.ts
Ensures consistent visual representation for various statuses.
// Comprehensive status handling
export const getStatusColor = (status: string, type: 'policy' | 'claim' | 'payment' | 'user'): string;
export const getStatusIcon = (status: string, size?: string): JSX.Element;
export const getPolicyIcon = (type: string, size?: string): JSX.Element;
export const getUserRoleIcon = (role: string, size?: string): JSX.Element;
// ... more status utilities

3. Reusable Modal Component
File: frontend/src/components/common/Modal.tsx
A single, flexible modal component replaces numerous custom implementations.
Before: 50+ lines per modal in each component. After: A concise 3 lines per modal usage.
<Modal
  isOpen={showModal}
  onClose={() => setShowModal(false)}
  title="Modal Title"
>
  {content}
</Modal>

4. Data Loading Hooks
File: frontend/src/hooks/useDataLoader.ts
Standardized data fetching and loading state management.
// Comprehensive data loading utilities
export function useDataLoader<T>(loadFunction, options): UseDataLoaderReturn<T>;
export function usePaginatedDataLoader<T>(loadFunction, initialLimit): PaginatedReturn<T>;
export function useFilteredDataLoader<T, F>(loadFunction, initialFilters): FilteredReturn<T>;

Impact: Replaced 30-50 lines of loading logic per component with a single hook call.
5. Reusable DataTable Component
File: frontend/src/components/common/DataTable.tsx
A powerful, configurable table component for displaying lists of data.
Before: 150+ lines per table component. After: A concise 10 lines of configuration.
<DataTable
  data={claims}
  columns={[
    { key: 'claimNumber', title: 'Claim #', sortable: true },
    { key: 'amount', title: 'Amount', format: 'currency' },
    { key: 'status', title: 'Status', format: 'status', statusType: 'claim' },
    { key: 'submittedDate', title: 'Submitted', format: 'date' }
  ]}
  searchable
  sortable
  onRowClick={(claim) => viewDetails(claim)}
/>

Benefits Achieved
●	Code Reduction: Over 2,500 lines eliminated across the codebase.
●	Maintainability: A single source of truth for common functionality simplifies updates.
●	Performance: Smaller bundle size due to code deduplication.
●	Developer Experience: Faster development with readily available reusable components.
Mock Data System
We implemented a comprehensive mock data system to centralize all sample data, ensuring consistency and ease of use.
Implementation Overview
1. Central Data Store
●	frontend/src/data/mockData.json (1,000+ lines)
○	Contains complete mock data for all entities: Users, Policies, Claims, Payments, Documents.
○	Includes admin statistics, recent activity, and quick actions.
○	Maintains realistic relationships between all data entities.
2. Data Service Layer
●	frontend/src/services/mockDataService.ts (300+ lines)
○	A centralized service class with over 30 methods for accessing mock data.
○	Provides type-safe data access methods.
○	Includes filtering and search capabilities.
○	Supports relationship-based queries to mimic real API responses.
Key Achievements
●	Data Consistency: All components now draw from the same data source, ensuring consistency.
●	Centralized Management: Data can be updated in one location, affecting all components.
●	Map Function Usage: Every component consistently uses .map() to render lists, optimizing React's rendering with proper key props.
●	Realistic Demo: The data relationships enhance the believability of the demo experience.
Service Methods Available (Examples)
User Methods
●	getUsers(), getUserById(id), getUsersByRole(role)
●	getActiveUsers(), searchUsers(query)
Policy Methods
●	getPolicies(), getPoliciesByUserId(userId), getPoliciesByStatus(status)
●	getPoliciesByType(type), searchPolicies(query)
Claim Methods
●	getClaims(), getClaimsByUserId(userId), getClaimsByStatus(status)
●	getClaimsByPolicyId(policyId), searchClaims(query)
Usage Examples
Component Data Loading
// In any component
useEffect(() => {
  const userId = user?.id || '1'; // Default to user '1' if no user is logged in
  const userPolicies = mockDataService.getPoliciesByUserId(userId);
  setPolicies(userPolicies);
}, [user]);

Map Rendering
// Consistent pattern across all components
{policies.map((policy) => (
  <Card key={policy.id}>
    <h3>{policy.policyNumber}</h3>
    <p>{policy.type}</p>
    <StatusBadge status={policy.status} />
  </Card>
))}

cp .env.example .env

# Edit frontend environment file (e.g., set REACT_APP_API_URL)
# nano .env  # Add REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api

Phase 2: Database Setup
2.1 Database Connection Setup
# Return to backend directory
cd ../backend

# Generate Prisma client (always run after schema changes or initial setup)
npx prisma generate

# Check database connection (will fail if DB not configured or running)
npx prisma db pull --preview-feature # --preview-feature is for `db pull`

# If using local PostgreSQL and it's not running:

# brew services start postgresql@15 # macOS

# If you need to create a local database and user (Linux/macOS example):
# sudo -u postgres createdb assureme
# sudo -u postgres psql -c "ALTER USER postgres PASSWORD 'yourpassword';"
# Then update .env with local database URL:
# echo 'DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:yourpassword@localhost:5432/assureme"' >> .env

2.2 Database Schema and Seeding
# Push schema to database (creates/updates tables based on schema.prisma)
npx prisma db push

# Open Prisma Studio to visually inspect your database
npx prisma studio  # Opens browser at http://localhost:5555

# Seed database with sample data (populates tables with initial data)
npx prisma db seed

# Reset database if needed (WARNING: This DELETES ALL DATA!)
npx prisma db reset

Phase 3: Testing Framework Implementation (Review)
The project is already configured for Jest and Enzyme (frontend) and Jest (backend). These steps are primarily for understanding or if you had issues.
3.1 Remove Existing Testing Libraries (if you were migrating)
# Navigate to frontend
cd ../frontend

# (If needed) Remove old testing dependencies
# npm uninstall @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event

# Clear npm cache
# npm cache clean --force

3.2 Install Jest and Enzyme (already in package.json)

# npm install --save-dev jest-sonar-reporter

# (If needed) Install with legacy peer deps flag if issues arise
# npm install --save-dev enzyme @cfaester/enzyme-adapter-react-18 @types/enzyme --legacy-peer-deps

3.3 Configure Testing Environment (already configured)
●	src/setupTests.ts (for frontend) is automatically detected by Create React App.
●	Jest configuration is typically in package.json or jest.config.js.
3.4 Generate Test Files (if you use a generator)
●	This project has existing test files. If you use a custom script to generate boilerplate tests, you'd run it here.
Phase 4: Development Server Startup
4.1 Start Backend Server
# Navigate to backend (if not already there)
cd backend

# Start development server with hot reload (uses ts-node)
npm run dev

# Alternative: Start production build (after npm run build)
# npm start

# Check server status (optional)
# curl http://localhost:5000/api/health # If a health endpoint exists

4.2 Start Frontend Server
# Open new terminal window/tab
# Navigate to frontend
cd frontend

# Start React development server (uses react-scripts)
npm start

# Frontend should open automatically at http://localhost:3000
# If not, manually open: http://localhost:3000

4.3 Verify Both Servers
# Check if backend API is responding
curl http://localhost:5000/api

# Check if frontend is accessible
curl http://localhost:3000

# Check if processes are running (Linux/macOS)
# lsof -i :5000  # Backend
# lsof -i :3000  # Frontend

Phase 5: Running Tests
5.1 Frontend Testing
# Navigate to frontend
cd frontend

# Run all frontend tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in CI mode (non-interactive, good for pipelines)
npm run test:ci

# Run specific test file
npm test -- Dashboard.test.tsx

# Run tests matching a pattern
npm test -- --testNamePattern="should render"

# Generate coverage report (opens in browser)
npm run coverage:report

# Check coverage files (list them)
ls -la coverage/

5.2 Backend Testing
# Navigate to backend
cd ../backend

# Run all backend tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- authController.test.ts

# Run tests in watch mode (re-runs on file changes)
npm run test:watch

5.3 Combined Testing
# From project root (if scripts exist in root package.json)
# npm run test:all
# npm run coverage:full

# Manual combined testing example:
# cd frontend && npm run test:ci && cd ../backend && npm run test:coverage

Phase 6: Code Quality and Linting
6.1 TypeScript Compilation Check
# Frontend TypeScript check (checks for type errors without building)
cd frontend
npx tsc --noEmit

# Backend TypeScript check
cd ../backend
npx tsc --noEmit

# Build TypeScript (backend) - also performs type checking
npm run build

6.2 Linting and Code Quality
# Frontend linting
cd frontend
npm run lint  # If script exists
npx eslint src/ --ext .ts,.tsx

# Backend linting
cd ../backend
npm run lint  # If script exists
npx eslint src/ --ext .ts

# Fix auto-fixable linting issues
npx eslint src/ --ext .ts,.tsx --fix

6.3 Prettier Formatting
# Format frontend code
cd frontend
npx prettier --write "src/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,json,css,md}"

# Format backend code
cd ../backend
npx prettier --write "src/**/*.{ts,js,json,md}"

Phase 7: Build and Production
7.1 Production Builds
# Build frontend for production (creates optimized static files)
cd frontend
npm run build

# Verify build output
ls -la build/
du -sh build/  # Check build size

# Build backend for production (compiles TypeScript to JavaScript)
cd ../backend
npm run build

# Verify backend build output
ls -la dist/

7.2 Production Testing (Local)
# Test production frontend build locally (requires `serve` package)
# npm install -g serve
# cd frontend
# serve -s build -l 3000

# Test production backend (run compiled JS in production mode)
# cd ../backend
# NODE_ENV=production npm start

Phase 8: Git Operations and Deployment
8.1 Git Workflow
# Check git status
git status

# Add all changes
git add .

# Check what will be committed
git diff --cached

# Commit changes with a descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: implement comprehensive Jest and Enzyme testing suite with 90%+ coverage"

# Push to your remote repository
git push origin main

# Create a feature branch for new work
git checkout -b feature/your-new-feature
git push -u origin feature/your-new-feature

8.2 GitHub Repository Operations
# Check remote repository setup
git remote -v

# Fetch latest changes from remote
git fetch origin

# Pull latest changes from main branch
git pull origin main

# Push a specific branch
git push origin feature/your-new-feature

# Create and push tags (for releases)
git tag -a v2.0.0 -m "Version 2.0.0 - Complete testing implementation"
git push origin v2.0.0

Phase 9: Quick Development Workflow
9.1 Daily Development Startup
We have a handy start-dev.sh script for this:
# From project root (AssureMe_Insurance/)
./start-dev.sh

This script will:
●	Check prerequisites (Node.js, npm).
●	Install dependencies if node_modules are missing.
●	Create .env files if they don't exist.
●	Start the backend server (npm run dev in backend/).
●	Start the frontend server (npm start in frontend/).
●	Provide URLs for your app and API docs.
●	Remind you of demo login credentials.
●	Keep both processes running and monitor them.
9.2 Quick Testing Workflow
You can create a custom script for quick testing if you want to run specific tests.
# Example quick test script (e.g., scripts/test-all.sh)
#!/bin/bash
echo "Running comprehensive tests..."

# Frontend tests
echo "Running frontend tests..."
cd frontend && npm run test:ci

# Backend tests
echo "Running backend tests..."
cd ../backend && npm run test:coverage

# Generate coverage report (optional)
echo "Generating coverage report..."
cd ../frontend && npm run coverage:report

echo "All tests completed!"

Phase 10: Troubleshooting Commands
These commands are essential for debugging.
10.1 Common Fix Commands
# Clear all node_modules and package-lock.json, then reinstall (the "nuclear option" that often works)
rm -rf frontend/node_modules frontend/package-lock.json
rm -rf backend/node_modules backend/package-lock.json
cd frontend && npm install
cd ../backend && npm install

# Clear npm cache (can fix corrupted package downloads)
npm cache clean --force

# Reset database (WARNING: This DELETES ALL DATA in your database!)
cd backend && npx prisma db reset

# Clear React build cache (if frontend build issues persist)
cd frontend && rm -rf build/ && npm run build

# Kill processes on specific ports (if "Port already in use" errors)
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9  # Kill frontend process (macOS/Linux)
lsof -ti:5000 | xargs kill -9  # Kill backend process (macOS/Linux)
# For Windows, use Task Manager or `netstat -ano | findstr :<PORT>` then `taskkill /PID <PID> /F`

10.2 Debugging Commands
# Check running Node.js processes
ps aux | grep node # Linux/macOS

# Check port usage
netstat -tulpn | grep :3000 # Linux
netstat -tulpn | grep :5000 # Linux
# For Windows, use `netstat -ano`

# Check system resources (if performance is an issue)
free -h  # Memory usage (Linux/macOS)
df -h    # Disk usage (Linux/macOS)
# On Windows, use Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc)

# View logs (if your app writes logs)
cd backend && npm run dev 2>&1 | tee backend.log # Redirects output to log file
cd frontend && npm start 2>&1 | tee frontend.log # Redirects output to log file
# Then view with: tail -f backend.log

Phase 11: Performance and Monitoring
11.1 Performance Testing
# Frontend bundle analysis (requires `webpack-bundle-analyzer` dev dependency)
cd frontend
npm run build
npx webpack-bundle-analyzer build/static/js/*.js

# Backend performance testing (requires `artillery` installed globally)
# npm install -g artillery
# artillery quick --count 10 --num 10 http://localhost:5000/api # Simple load test

# Memory usage monitoring for Node.js backend
# node --inspect backend/dist/server.js # Then open Chrome DevTools and connect

11.2 Coverage and Quality Reports
# Generate detailed test coverage reports (opens in browser)
cd frontend
npm run test:coverage
open coverage/lcov-report/index.html  # macOS
xdg-open coverage/lcov-report/index.html  # Linux

# Check TypeScript coverage (requires `type-coverage` dev dependency)
# npx type-coverage --detail

# Run security audit
npm audit
npm audit fix

Phase 12: Deployment Commands
12.1 Pre-deployment Checks
# Run all quality checks before deploying
cd frontend
npm run lint && npm run test:ci && npm run build

cd ../backend
npm run lint && npm run test:coverage && npm run build

# Verify NODE_ENV is set to production for backend
cd backend && node -e "console.log('NODE_ENV:', process.env.NODE_ENV)"

12.2 Deployment to Production
# Build for production (ensures latest optimized code)
cd frontend && npm run build
cd ../backend && npm run build

# Deploy to Vercel (frontend) - requires Vercel CLI installed globally and logged in
# npm install -g vercel
# cd frontend
# vercel --prod

# Deploy to Render (backend) - typically done via Git push to connected repository
# git push origin main # Render will automatically build and deploy

Summary of Essential Commands
Daily Development Commands
# Start development (from root)
./start-dev.sh

# Run tests (from respective frontend/backend folders)
npm test

# Check code quality
npx tsc --noEmit  # TypeScript check
npm run lint      # ESLint check

Deployment Commands
# Build for production (from respective frontend/backend folders)
npm run build

# Push to repository (from root)
git add . && git commit -m "feat: your changes" && git push

# Deploy (automatic via connected services like Vercel/Render)

Troubleshooting Commands
# Reset all node_modules and reinstall (from root or respective folders)
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install

# Reset database (from backend folder)
npx prisma db reset

# Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force

Pro Tips for Smooth Development
1.	Always run TypeScript check before committing: npx tsc --noEmit
2.	Use multiple terminals for development: One for backend, one for frontend, one for testing, etc.
3.	Regular health checks: curl http://localhost:5000/api && curl http://localhost:3000
4.	Before major changes, create a backup branch: git branch backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)
5.	Monitor test coverage regularly: npm run test:coverage && open coverage/lcov-report/index.html
